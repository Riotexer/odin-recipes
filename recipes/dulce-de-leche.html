        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 gallon milk</li>
            <li>1 vanilla bean</li>
            <li>4 and a half cups white sugar</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large saucepan, bring milk to a boil over medium-high heat. Remove from heat and strain through cheesecloth. Return to pan.</li>
            <li>Cut vanilla bean in half and pour the seeds in the milk. Stir in the sugar and replace the pan on medium-high heat, stirring constantly until the sugar is dissolved.

When a wooden spoon drawn through the mixture leaves the bottom of the pan visible, and the mixture is light brown in color, remove the pan from the heat.</li>
